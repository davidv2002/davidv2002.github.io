          Let us start with my newest computer which is my new laptop a Lenovo ThinkPad E595, that uses the 4 core 8 thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500U apu with the Radeon Vega 8 gpu; it is a
          workhorse laptop and a masive upgrade from my old but still working, Acer Aspire A315 that was using the Amd A9-9420 1 core 2 thread apu with the Radeon R5 gpu; it is now a linux only system.
          <br>
          Next we come to my gaming desktop a custom that I built myself. It is an overclocked Amd Ryzen 5 2600 that is clocked at 3.85GHZ all core; that is cooled with a 240mm aio liquid cooler that I put
          2 4100rpm fans on each rated at 143CFM. The gpu is an overclocked AMD RX570 8GB card; that is overclocked not just for performance but to help rase the voltage, which helps fix an intermittent fault
          which cuases system lockup. For storage I am using three drives 2 ssds and 1 hdd, the ssds are a pair of missmatched WD blue SATA drives that are running in software RAID for a read speed of 8.8Gb per second
          the hdd is just a old 2TB Seagate Barracuda for extra storage. The rest of the parts are 2 8GB low speed ram stick a 750 watt psu and a x370 motherboard.
