        <p>
          Let us start with my newest computer which is my new laptop a Lenovo ThinkPad E595, that uses the 4 core 8 thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500U apu with the Radeon Vega 8 gpu; it is a
          workhorse laptop and a masive upgrade from my old but still working, Acer Aspire A315 that was using the Amd A9-9420 1 core 2 thread apu with the Radeon R5 gpu; it is now a linux only system.
          <br>
          Next we come to my gaming desktop a custom that I built myself. It is an overclocked Amd Ryzen 5 2600 that is clocked at 3.85GHZ all core; that is cooled with a 240mm aio liquid cooler that I put
          2 4100rpm fans on each rated at 143CFM. The gpu is an overclocked AMD RX570 8GB card; that is overclocked not just for performance but to help rase the voltage, which helps fix an intermittent fault
          which cuases system lockup. For storage I am using three drives 2 ssds and 1 hdd, the ssds are a pair of missmatched WD blue SATA drives that are running in software RAID for a read speed of 8.8Gb per second
          The hdd is just an old 2TB Seagate Barracuda for extra storage. The rest of the parts are 2 8GB low speed ram stick a 750 watt psu and a x370 motherboard.
          <br>
          My final new thing is not a computer but a 3d printer; an Anet a6 Chinese kit printer that was a lot of work to get working and saddly I am yet to get it set up sence moving to Edmonton,but once I get it set up I will be building an enclosure for it.
          The video below is some time lapses of it working.

        <p>
          The computer that i am curently working on is a 1 GHZ Coppermine P3 Windows 98 system that does not
          like any drives above 50 GB and half the time it fails to boot because the bios thinks that the CPU is not stable.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my prior computers that I have gotten working is an old Windows XP Core 2 Quad Q9400 that I have upgraded from the P4 dual core version of the Core 2 duo E4300 that I have added
          : a 1GB Nvidia 9500gt, 8GB of ddr2 ram, SoundBlaster Audigy platinum EX and just some random wireless N card:
           all booting form a 160GB Seagate barracuda, it also dual boots ubuntu 20.04 because XP can not access a lot of the internet do to the age of the version of chrome that it supports.
           The file below is a deja vu midi played using the kite sound font on the sound card for some post processing.
