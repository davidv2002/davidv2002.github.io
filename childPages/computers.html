      <article>
        <p>
          Let us start with my newest computer which is my new laptop a Lenovo ThinkPad E595, that uses the 4 core 8 thread AMD Ryzen 5 3500U APU with the Radeon Vega 8 GPU; it is a
          workhorse laptop and a massive upgrade from my old but still working, Acer Aspire A315 that was using the Amd A9-9420 1 core 2 thread Apu with the Radeon R5 GPU; it is now a Linux only system.
          <br>
          Next we come to my gaming desktop a custom that I built myself. It is an overclocked Amd Ryzen 5 2600 that is overclocked to 3.85GHZ all cores; that is cooled with a 240mm aio liquid cooler that I put
          2 4100rpm fans on each rated at 143CFM. The GPU is an overclocked AMD RX570 8GB card; that is overclocked not just for performance but to help raise the voltage, which helps fix an intermittent fault
          which causes system lockup. For storage I am using three drives 2 SSDs and 1 HDD, the SSDs are a pair of mismatched WD blue SATA drives that are running in software RAID for a read speed of 8.8Gb per second
          The HDD is just an old 2TB Seagate Barracuda for extra storage. The rest of the parts are 2 8GB low speed ram stick a 750 watt PSU and a X370 motherboard.
          <br>
          My final new thing is not a computer but a 3d printer; an Anet a6 Chinese kit printer that was a lot of work to get working and sadly I am yet to get it set up sense moving to Edmonton,
          but once I get it set up I will be building an enclosure for it. The video below is some time lapses of it working.

          The computer that I am currently working on is using the 1GHZ Coppermine P3, one of the first CPUs to hit 1GHZ and cost almost $1000 back in 2000;
          20 years later now that I have gotten my hands on it, it is unstable due to the fact that the bios thinks that the CPU is not working half the time.
          I also do not yet have a sound card for it; I do however have 1GB of PC133 ram installed, the max that windows 98SE will allow.
          Also it does not like HDDs bigger then 30GB that is why it is booting from a old compact flash card, because I do not have an IDE hard drive that it will accept.

          One of my prior computers that I have gotten working is an old Windows XP Core 2 Quad Q9400 that I have upgraded from the P4 dual core version of the Core 2 duo E4300 that I have added
          : a 1GB NVIDIA 9500gt, 8GB of ddr2 ram, Sound Blaster Audigy platinum EX and just some random wireless N card:
           all booting form a 160GB Seagate barracuda, it also dual boots Ubuntu 20.04 because XP can not access a lot of the internet do to the age of the version of chrome that it supports.
           The file below is a deja vu midi played using <a href="https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=351893" target="_blank">the kite sound font</a> on the sound card for some post processing.

            My coolest old computer has too be my server that I am trying to get working. It is an old Dell PowerEdge 2850 using 320U SCSI that I am refitting for SATA 2,
            using a PCIX SATA raid card that I have already gotten. It uses 2 double threaded single core Netburst Xeons with slow speed 400mhz
            ECC ddr2 ram. but despite all that it still works and runs Windows Server 08 R2 and is going to be the FTP server at the core of my home network, when I finely get it working.
