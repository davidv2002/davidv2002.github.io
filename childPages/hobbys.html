        My most importent hobby is helping my family wherever and whenever I can; for instance my garndmother is a foster parent who mostly deals with medically fragile children.
        because of that I am able to mix meds for use with a feeding tube and feed children using both an NG tube as well as a standard gastric feeding tube, but I also have
        experance with some of the more normal things such as changing diapers (I have just done with a serverly developmentally delayed teenager as well as babys) and of
        course putting together cribs as well as installing car seats.</p>
        <p>
          Another one of my hobbys conects to the one above, as that brought along my last chance to work on it.<br>I enjoy digital photography especaly when I travel and so just before school started
          I spent a week on a road trip throgh BC. I was there to help look after my 3 year old uncle and to help my grandmother do repair work on the cross of her son who died when his simi truck rolled over
          and caught fire. Other then the sad purpose of the trip; It was a lot of fun and I took some pictures on my 15 year old softmoded Canon dslr camara, one of which I have put below.</p>

    <p> One of my favorite things to do is work on computers; I like to do it so much that I am going to put it on a different page. Due to the amount of things that I want to talk about.</p>
