  50 word description of me
  my name is David Verbeek and I am a computer science student at queen e high school in Edmonton, the city where I was born. my family however comes from England which is a culture with many amazing foods like: mincemeat pies, sausage rolls and of coarse a good cup of black tea.

  50 Word Description of my Career Plans
  my Career plan is to go to University of Alberta for engineering specialising in computer architecture micro assembly and then my hope is to work in AMDs CPU division. In order to get there I have to complete math 30-1 and 31, English 30-1, Social 30-1 and, both chemistry a physics 30.

  I am a trained martial artist, specifically I am a red belt in taekwondo. I am also an Appalachian mountain step dancer, something I have done for almost my whole life. I have experience babysitting highly medically children: including mixing meds, feeding using an NG tube and of course changing diapers.

  One of my favourite thing to do is work on my old computers, currently I am trying to learn how to use windows 98 SE well debugging a 1 GHZ Coppermine P3 that does not like any drives above 50 GB and have the time it fails to boot because the bios thinks that the CPU is not stable.

  One of my prior computers that I have gotten working is an old Windows XP Core 2 Quad Q9400 that I have upgraded from the P4 dual core version of the Core 2 duo E4300 that I have added: a 1GB Nvidia 9500gt, 8GB of ddr2 ram, SoundBlaster Audigy platinum EX and just some random wireless N card: all booting form a 160GB Seagate barracuda, it also dual boots ubuntu 20.04 because XP can not access a lot of the internet do to the age of the version of chrome that it supports.

  My coolest old computer has too be my server that I am trying to get working, it is a old Dell PowerEdge 2850 SCSI based server that I am refitting for SATA 2: it uses 2 double treaded single core Netburst Xeons with slow speed 400mhz ECC ddr2 ram. but despite all that it still works and runs Windows Server 08 R2 and is going to be the FTP server at the core of my home network, when I finely get it working.  

  I also have gotten my own 3d printer working an Anet a6 Chinese kit printer and it was a lot of work but I have not gotten it set back up after I moved to Edmonton, but once I get it set up I will be building an enclosure for it.

  I also enjoy learn about new things and when ever I got into something I will give it my all, and nothing will stop me.
